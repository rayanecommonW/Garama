## General rules

- Mininal data needed by the test
- Fixtures should live in a separate file and follow the collocation rules
- Use the `.fixture.ts` file extension

## Regarding typescript

- Use types at the top level – (Note: this is useful for developers editing fixtures)
- Allow use of any for nested objects (prefer keeping the data minimal)
